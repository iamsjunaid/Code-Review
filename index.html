          Christian Atsu Twasam (10 January 1992 to 18 February 2023) was a
          Ghanaian professional footballer who primarily played as a winger,
          although he was also deployed as an attacking midfielder or left back.
          Atsu began his career with Porto, also spending a season on loan at
          Rio Ave. In 2013, he was signed by Chelsea for £3.5 million, who
          subsequently loaned him to Vitesse Arnhem, Everton, AFC Bournemouth
          and Málaga. After spending the 2016–17 season on loan at Newcastle
          United, he completed a permanent transfer to the club in May 2017.
          Following the end of his four-year contract he played for Al Raed in
          Saudi Arabia and Hatayspor in Turkey, where he died in the 2023
          Turkey–Syria earthquake at age 31. A full international with 65 caps
          from 2012 to 2019, Atsu represented Ghana at the 2014 FIFA World Cup
          and four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. He helped the team finish
          as runners-up at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, in which he also won
          Player of the Tournament and Goal of the Tournament.
